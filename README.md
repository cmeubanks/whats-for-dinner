# What's For Dinner?

### Description
Interactive webpage that will generate a random meal for the user based on the selected parameters of:
side dish, main dish, dessert, or entire meal

### How it Works
The user must select one of four radio buttons and then click the "Let's Cook" button to have a meal idea randomly generated.
The website stores arrays of different food selections for the event listener functions to grab the random meal choice. Once the website registers a 'click', the functions are invoked and return the user's proposed, random meal selection in an HTML element container.

### Technologies Implemented:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Github
- Chrome Extensions: ColorPick

### Future Updates
- The ability for the user to add their own recipes and also "like" their favorite recipes.
- Clear button to be enabled
- CSS styling will be tweaked so that the webpage will respond to the user's screen size and adapt to mobile and large screens.
